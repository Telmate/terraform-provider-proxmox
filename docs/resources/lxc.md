# LXC Resource

This resource creates and manages a Proxmox LXC container.

## Example Usage

### Basic example

```hcl
resource "proxmox_lxc" "basic" {
  target_node  = "pve"
  hostname     = "lxc-basic"
  ostemplate   = "local:vztmpl/ubuntu-20.04-standard_20.04-1_amd64.tar.gz"
  password     = "BasicLXCContainer"
  unprivileged = true

  // Terraform will crash without rootfs defined
  rootfs {
    storage = "local-zfs"
    size    = "8G"
  }

  network {
    name   = "eth0"
    bridge = "vmbr0"
    ip     = "dhcp"
  }
}
```

### Multiple mount points

-> By specifying `local-lvm:12` for the `mountpoint.storage` attribute in the first `mountpoint` block below, a volume
will be automatically created for the LXC container. For more information on this behaviour,
see [Storage Backed Mount Points](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#_storage_backed_mount_points).

```hcl
resource "proxmox_lxc" "multiple_mountpoints" {
  target_node  = "pve"
  hostname     = "lxc-multiple-mountpoints"
  ostemplate   = "local:vztmpl/ubuntu-20.04-standard_20.04-1_amd64.tar.gz"
  unprivileged = true
  ostype       = "ubuntu"

  ssh_public_keys = <<-EOT
    ssh-rsa <public_key_1> user@example.com
    ssh-ed25519 <public_key_2> user@example.com
  EOT

  // Terraform will crash without rootfs defined
  rootfs {
    storage = "local-zfs"
    size    = "8G"
  }

  // Storage Backed Mount Point
  mountpoint {
    key     = "0"
    slot    = 0
    storage = "local-lvm"
    mp      = "/mnt/container/storage-backed-mount-point"
    size    = "12G"
  }

  // Bind Mount Point
  mountpoint {
    key     = "1"
    slot    = 1
    storage = "/srv/host/bind-mount-point"
    // Without 'volume' defined, Proxmox will try to create a volume with
    // the value of 'storage' + : + 'size' (without the trailing G) - e.g.
    // "/srv/host/bind-mount-point:256".
    // This behaviour looks to be caused by a bug in the provider.
    volume  = "/srv/host/bind-mount-point"
    mp      = "/mnt/container/bind-mount-point"
    size    = "256G"
  }

  // Device Mount Point
  mountpoint {
    key     = "2"
    slot    = 2
    storage = "/dev/sdg"
    volume  = "/dev/sdg"
    mp      = "/mnt/container/device-mount-point"
    size    = "32G"
  }

  network {
    name   = "eth0"
    bridge = "vmbr0"
    ip     = "dhcp"
    ip6    = "dhcp"
  }
}
```

### LXC with advanced features enabled

```hcl
resource "proxmox_lxc" "advanced_features" {
  target_node  = "pve"
  hostname     = "lxc-advanced-features"
  ostemplate   = "local:vztmpl/ubuntu-20.04-standard_20.04-1_amd64.tar.gz"
  unprivileged = true

  ssh_public_keys = <<-EOT
    ssh-rsa <public_key_1> user@example.com
    ssh-ed25519 <public_key_2> user@example.com
  EOT

  features {
    fuse    = true
    nesting = true
    mount   = "nfs;cifs"
  }

  // Terraform will crash without rootfs defined
  rootfs {
    storage = "local-zfs"
    size    = "8G"
  }

  // NFS share mounted on host
  mountpoint {
    slot    = "0"
    storage = "/mnt/host/nfs"
    mp      = "/mnt/container/nfs"
    size    = "250G"
  }

  network {
    name   = "eth0"
    bridge = "vmbr0"
    ip     = "10.0.0.2/24"
    ip6    = "auto"
  }
}
```

### Clone basic example

```hcl
resource "proxmox_lxc" "basic" {
  target_node = "pve"
  hostname    = "lxc-clone"
  #id of lxc container to clone
  clone       = "8001"
}
```

## Argument Reference

### Required

The following arguments must be defined when using this resource:

* `target_node` - A string containing the cluster node name.

### Optional

-> While the following arguments are optional, some have child arguments that are required when using the parent
argument (e.g. `name` in the `network` attribute). These child arguments have been marked with "__(required)__".

The following arguments may be optionally defined when using this resource:

* `ostemplate` - The [volume identifier](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#_volumes) that points to
  the OS template or backup file.

* `clone` - The lxc vmid to clone
* `clone_storage` - Target storage for full clone.
* `cmode` - Configures console mode. `"tty"` tries to open a connection to one of the available tty devices. `"console"`
  tries to attach to `/dev/console` instead. `"shell"` simply invokes a shell inside the container (no login). Default
  is `"tty"`.
* `console` - A boolean to attach a console device to the container. Default is `true`.
* `cores` - The number of cores assigned to the container. A container can use all available cores by default.
* `cpulimit` - A number to limit CPU usage by. Default is `0`.
